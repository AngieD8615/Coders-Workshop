# Collatz Sequence Test

The Collatz sequence test code will never actually return for some value if in
fact the Collatz conjecture is false, so we'll just run the code and hope for
the best.

The program here finds the longest Collatz sequence between 1 and the specified
command-line argument. It uses a simple for-loop to call a tracing version of
the recursive Collatz-sequence function.
