A 4 x 5 matrix looks like this:

    1   2   3   4   5
    6   7   8   9  10
    11 12  13  14  15
    16 17  18  19  20

If we start at 1 and go clockwise, we'll hit every element. But if we start at
15 and go clockwise, we'll miss elements 12, 13, and 14.

A useful exercise would be to extend the algorithm to allow for turning in a
clockwise direction.

Another exercise: add a parameter to the Matrix constructor that's an array of
"pillar" matrix indices: places in the matrix that can't be occupied by Nodes.
Can you change the data structures and algorithms so as to guarantee that a
traversal will eventually visit every Node in the matrix? What arrangements of
pillars prevent such a traversal?
