# Clockwise Spiral

This solution to the clockwise spiral problem illustrates the use of novel
data structures to simplify and provide shape to a problem.

The key data structures are:

- `MonitorableGrid`: a transformation of the input matrix into a markable
graph.
- `Cell`: the contents of values in MonitorableGrid objects.
- `Roomba`: a mindless traverser of matrices.
